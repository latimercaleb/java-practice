# SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics
* SVG has 3 main tags `<svg>` which is the root, several basic shape tags, and the `<g>` tag for grouping things
* SVGs can get complex, they have gradients, animations and other css & js properties natively

SVG is `XML-like` and therefore case-sensitive and numbers need to be in quotes
